Planned Features:

1. Year to Year profit bar chart
2. Success by stock breakdowns, Win rates on particular stocks
3. Also we want a month by month chart, using closing dates as when we
   "made/lost" money
4. Ignore some bad data, Joonie's page has hidden trades which should not break
   everything
